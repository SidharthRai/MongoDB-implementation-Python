# MongoDB Implementation using Python3
<b>MongoDB</b> is a document-oriented, open-source database program that is platform-independent. <br>
<b>MongoEngine</b> is an object document mapper (ODM), which is roughly equivalent to a SQL-based object relational mapper (ORM). The abstraction provided by MongoEngine is class-based, so all of the models you create are classes.

<b> Requirements:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Download and install Mongodb on your machine from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/</li>
  <li> pymongo==3.4.0</li>
  <li> mongoengine==0.10.7</li>
</ul>
